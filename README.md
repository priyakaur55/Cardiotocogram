# Automated Cardiotocogram Analysis to Improve Maternal and Child Health Outcomes through Machine Learning

Child and maternal mortality remain significant global challenges, reflecting not only healthcare access but also the quality of care provided. In alignment with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, there is a concerted effort to end preventable deaths among newborns and children under 5 years of age by 2030, with a specific target of reducing under-5 mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1,000 live births.
Maternal mortality, accounting for 295,000 deaths during and following pregnancy and childbirth as of 2017, remains a critical concern, particularly in low-resource settings where 94% of these deaths occur. Many of these maternal deaths are preventable with timely intervention and access to quality healthcare.
One cost-effective and accessible tool for assessing foetal health and mitigating the risks associated with maternal and child mortality is the Cardiotocogram (CTG). By utilizing ultrasound pulses to monitor foetal heart rate (FHR), foetal movements, uterine contractions, and other vital parameters, CTGs provide valuable insights into the well-being of both mother and child.
This project aims to revolutionize obstetric care by leveraging machine learning techniques to automate Cardiotocogram analysis. Through sophisticated algorithms, including deep learning models, feature engineering, and signal processing, our system will classify Cardiotocogram patterns into distinct categories denoting normalcy, suspicion, or pathology. Additionally, it will provide quantitative evaluations of foetal heart rate variability and uterine contractions intensity, aiding healthcare professionals in making informed decisions and interventions.
Automating Cardiotocogram analysis not only enhances the efficiency and accuracy of foetal monitoring but also reduces the burden on healthcare providers, particularly in resource-constrained settings. By empowering clinicians with timely insights, our system has the potential to prevent adverse maternal and child health outcomes, contributing to the global efforts to reduce child and maternal mortality rates.
Through this innovative approach, we aim to advance prenatal care and contribute to achieving the UN's Sustainable Development Goals by improving access to quality healthcare and ultimately saving lives.
